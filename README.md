# General Dino

A general BE for my projects in Deno (hence General Dino). ðŸ¦–

## Prerequisities

- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)

## Run project locally

Download remote environment configuration from Vercel by running:

```
vercel env pull
```

The project is hosted in serverless functions on Vercel, so to start it locally simply run:

```
vercel dev
```
